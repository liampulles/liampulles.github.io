    <p>I recently watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/7FtNjeYKVAE?t=942">conversation between Dave Farley and Dave Thomas</a> where they discussed and debated the utility of automated tests. This made me wonder...what is worth testing? Given a fixed amount of time, what parts should be tested as a priority?</p>
    <p>In this article, I'll try and give my stab at an answer.</p>
