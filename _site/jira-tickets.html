but many view them as a form of admin drudgery.<p>When I was starting out, I had this view too - but I've since come to view tickets as a vital part of my workflow.
In fact I'd put them at a similar weight to my IDE in terms of value (seriously). Here I'll show you how I use them
in the hopes that it will give you some ideas.</section><section><h2 id="Tickets as a blueprint"><a class=anchor href=#Tickets%20as%20a%20blueprint>Tickets as a blueprint</a></h2><aside><figure><img src=/images/thinking-dev.webp width=512px height=512px alt="A software developer leaning back in his chair thinking hard about his work. Thought bubbles, casual clothing, brown hair."></figure></aside><p>When I pick up a ticket, I'll start by making a series of TODOs on it, and then
continue to refine it down into the finest detail I can. For simple tasks, this is
a 10 minute procedure - for more complex ones, it can easily take an hour (or more).<p>I usually start by making bullet points which list the high level elements involved
(e.g. this db table, this service, this util, etc). Then I will turn this into a
series of explicit steps (e.g. migrate the column for this table, delete this code,
create a new service class, etc).<p>The rule I have in mind when doing this is to get to the point where there is no
ambiguity about what needs to be done. I will look through the codebase and talk
to people while I do this.<p>Some notes on this:<ol><li>Planning upfront like this inevitably leads to better design and less rework.
I'll see that steps conflict and rewrite the plan before rewriting the code.<li>Since I've done the thinking upfront, when I do get to coding, I can get into
&quot;flow&quot; more easily and hold on to it for longer.<li>And since I'm in flow for longer, I find that I complete my work more quickly
(even with the added planning time).<li>As I progress through my TODOs, I mark the individual pieces as [DONE]. This keeps
me motivated, and gives me an accurate indication of progress.<li>I think this has made me better at seeing what is involved in a ticket off the
cuff. This helps immensely during stand up and sprint planning.<li>My ability to estimate tasks has improved. And if the task does go over, this TODO
list serves as a good resource for me to explain <em>why</em> I need to go over.<li>If I see any tasks that need to be done first, I'll action those upfront. For
example, I might talk with another team to update their API so they can do that
while I am busy. This obviously helps avoid blocks/stucks.<li>TODOs help immensely with context switching. When I switch tickets, I can read my
TODOs and jump back in to coding. Also if I am waiting on something (e.g. a
deployment), then I can easily find something small from these lists to action.<li>I am hoping that these TODOs act as a historical artifact for future devs (they
can see my reasons for writing such bad code. ðŸ˜‰)<li>I've gotten feedback from my manager and colleagues that these TODOs help a lot
to get a sense of my progress (particularly when there are tasks dependent on my
work). This pre-sight helps them to plan and for me to explain my work.</ol><p>Note that this does not stop unexpected things from coming up during coding, but it
does help reduce them. And when those moments do come up I try to go and plan again
before coding.</section><section><h2 id="Tickets as a second brain"><a class=anchor href=#Tickets%20as%20a%20second%20brain>Tickets as a second brain</a></h2><aside><figure><img src=/images/thinking-goldfish.webp width=512px height=512px alt="A goldfish leaning back in his chair thinking hard about his work. Thought bubbles."></figure></aside><p>I often say (only half joking) that I have the memory of a goldfish. I treat my
brain as an ephemeral cache: any value could fall away at any time. My tickets
serve as a backing database for my brain.<p>Extending this cache-db analogy: I'll write to that persistent storage regularly.
If, while coding, a disparate question pops into my brain - I'll note the question
down in the ticket and then carry on coding. This keeps me in flow. Later I will
look through the ticket and ensure all items are actioned before submitting for
review.<p>This practice serves to enable a kind of agile Plan-Do-Reflect mode of working.
Instead of just barraging through code, uncertain of where I am going, I am making
steady steps with a clear path ahead. It leads to more inner peace (I think).</section><section><h2 id="Tickets as asynchronous communication"><a class=anchor href=#Tickets%20as%20asynchronous%20communication>Tickets as asynchronous communication</a></h2><aside><figure><img src=/images/thinking-cyberpunk.webp width=512px height=512px alt="A man sitting in his chair hacking into the matrix."></figure></aside><p>I work at a fully remote company, and so good asynchronous communication is vital.
If I have a ticket-related question then I will sometimes ping colleagues on a
ticket rather than slack them. My rationale being:<ul><li>They get the notification via email and so are not interrupted (by a slack
notification bell).<li>The context for the question is on the ticket itself.<li>That conversation, and all other relevant conversations, are all available on
the ticket.</ul><p>Although having said that, people's preferences differ, and one should respect the
communication channels others prefer (especially when asking them for help).</section><section><h2 id=Conclusion><a class=anchor href=#Conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2><p>Anyway, I hope I've given you something to think about. I'm curious if you have
found other good uses for tickets - if so, please do email me.</section></article></main><footer><p><b>Comments? Send me an <a href=mailto:me@liampulles.com>email</a>.
