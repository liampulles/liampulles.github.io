Just taking it on its own merits: this really is a very good action film.<p>The set pieces are raw and physical, Daniel Craig and Eva Green deliver very confident performances, and its as glamorous as one could ever hope for. Best opening sequence and song of a Bond film too, IMO.<p>I think it also balances the womanizing aspect of Bond well. Bond is that, but that is part of the job of a spy, and the women give as much as they take in this film.<p>The plot is a bit silly, but that's true of any Bond film (and most action films really) so... eh.<p>Definitely worth the re-watch.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/82HggH target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>Blade Runner (1982)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/78.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Blade Runner (1982)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 15 November 2024</i></header><p>I got to watch this in the cinema, and damn is it a good looking movie.

The locations are grungy, but the compositions are beautiful. Its a journey made up of detours.<p>The movie feels so distinct from the hyperactive movies of today, where there needs to be some exciting action scene or dramatic moment or laugh every 4.5 minutes.<p>I fought with myself to give this full marks, because usually what makes a movie &quot;Great&quot; for me is that there has to be at least one moment where I'm left in awe: a moment where the human condition is laid bear, or something is said that only a movie can say. Where the artifice drops and the film connects to my soul.<p>No such moment happened for me watching <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, but I think this is an exception to the rule.

I think what really makes this film work as well as it does is how finely it walks the line of being an emotional film and not a sentimental one. I think the use of lighting and music is deft and lifts the scenes up without them being overpowering. The acting is controlled: this is not a film with standout &quot;powerful&quot; performances, just good and appropriate ones.<p>And the script is controlled. This is a film which values simple prose. There are moments which are tense, but it is not an especially violent movie. Its certainly not an action movie or a thriller. These prisoners are not constantly a hair's breadth away from rioting- they are human beings just trying to get through.<p>The final thing that stood out for me was the rich texture of it all. Things have scratches on them. I can feel the grain of the denim, and I note how the uniforms are degraded slightly. The books in the library are uneven and yellowing. Bullets are splaid out haphazardly before inexperienced gun loaders chamber them in.<p>It is a beautiful story.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/7tjk7V target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Girls&#39; Night Out (1998)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/216027.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Girls&#39; Night Out (1998)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 26 August 2024</i></header><p>A typically well made South Korean slice-of-life flick.

That is surprising, because its not a horror, and there is little real violence. Its harrowing because it is a kind of domestic nightmare, and since it is a product of culture and the human condition, one knows that it must be widespread.<p>I think the film does well to somewhat humanize the villain of the piece: the husband. He is not ostensibly an evil man, rather he is a small-minded fool who has transplanted his upbringing rigidly into a foreign land. He is a bad man, because of what he is putting this woman through, but it is not the act of express malice but rather a very restricted worldview. I think if the film had leaned into making him malicious, it would have undercut the powerful social commentary; the realism of this scenario.<p>It is an unrelentingly depressing movie, which I have to say makes it unlikely I will watch it again, but it is a strong film nonetheless.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/5UGvxX target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>The World (2004)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/41292.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>The World (2004)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 24 February 2024</i></header><p><i>The World</i> is about people who are not living their dream lives.

Some hold on to hopes of escape. And some, now exiting their carefree youth, are starting to face the sheer horror of an unremarkable life.<p>This is a ripe theme for cinema to tackle, and indeed there are a few remarkable moments in this film.

Neither speaks the same language, and yet they have grown close through their shared experience. One has a boyfriend, and the other: a husband and children in another country.

I get that wistfulness takes time, but nonetheless it could have been done in 1h40 instead of 2h20. Also I feel that the actual setting of the film (the theme park) was underutilized and rather incidental to the film. Yes I get the metaphor: these are miniature monuments - second class representations of the real deal - I still think seeing more of the hustle and bustle of the theme park would have livened up what was a rather plodding pace.<p>Finally... the use of animation in this film.

Now Rikyu is very much a drama: with big themes around the tension between culture and power, for example.<p>Imagine my surprise then when the first third of this film makes it out to be about a warrior princess, with all the unrealistic combat abilities to boot. What a shift!<p>And then at around the 1/3 mark it seems to come to its senses, drop the warrior nonsense completely (the princess seemingly loses her abilities, and becomes a minor part of the film), and instead we pick up from the Rikyu themes to dive back into spiritual questions.<p>By spiritual, I really mean the impact of a rising Christianity in Japan. It was done rather thoughtfully I thought: its not about quoting scripture, but rather showing men rejecting the violent samurai or warlord lifestyle and instead pursuing more peaceful ways of existence. There are things explored here that I have not seen addressed in any other Japanese historical film, and it is done using the language of cinema, and I found it fascinating.<p>If only it had done this from the start! Actually as I write this, I wonder if that tonal shift is really the pacifist impact of Christianity... maybe so, but I will say some of the writing is a bit weak in this film; the plotting and dialogue were okay but nothing more.<p>Overall I was solidly entertained for 2 and a bit hours, which is no easy feat. I'll also mention that the film is very deftly scored: the theme is used very sparingly.

Infact I refuse.<p>As to what extent she believes in Nazi ideals is difficult to say, and really can never be conclusively answered. I think people will have to decide for themselves.<p>As to regarding the film making of this documentary, it difficult for it to go wrong. Leni's film history is captivating - her eye for composition is really masterful, and her variety of talents and dedication is almost unbelievable. Her shots, and her analysis of those shots, sell the film. But the handling of Leni is also quite admirable - I think it does well to point out the key questions, her statements, and the potential contradictions to her perspective - and then leave it for you to decide for yourself.<p>The only real pitfall of the film is the unfortunate contrast between the competence of Leni and Muller's footage. While the cinematography of this documentary would be perfectly fine anywhere else, it can do nothing but drag down the building height of the film when it is cut with Leni's.<p>I must conclude that this is the best film I've seen so far which examines a single creator's body of work.

The truest case of damned if you, damned if you don't that I have yet seen.<p>What lies at the heart of this film, is the idea that power corrupts - but not equally. The truth is that any country, without mechanisms which prevent government power (and even then...), are likely to be taken by opportunists. It's not even that the dictators were bad to start with, just that foreign and local interests have given them the confidence to unlock their hidden potential for evil.<p>This film makes one realize just how rare and precious truly peaceful revolutions are (and I include the post-revolution period). It makes me appreciate that my homeland of South Africa, despite heavy government corruption and deliberately divisive rhetoric, is one of the lucky ones. But if Mandela were in Lumumba's shoes, I don't know what he could have done to stem the inevitable downfall. This film is surprisingly even handed, and it is that which gives the film its potency and horror. The great evil is human nature, and not even Lumumba can defeat that.<p>It's not a boring film either.

Things are good. Our characters have jobs, they go home to their families and live life in peace with the other 11 million similar individuals. Similar - individuals.<p>The shots in this film show the best of Japan - tranquil beauty, peaceful housing projects, contemplative nights. The lighting in particular is excellent - the pitch blue morning, followed by the sparkling magic that is a golden sunrise is miraculous. Too beautiful.<p>The people in this film (cult members and not) are maniacally content; living in meaningless satisfaction. The natural drive or struggle for life is not external for these people, but internal. After a certain point of watching so many long, still scenes mixed with awkward, incomplete people - the idea that it could them towards the insane becomes more and more understandable. I had a similar feeling after a certain point in watching <i>Gerry</i>.<p>Certainly, there is no reason in it. Some cult members see the meaning in books, some find the meaning in relationships - it's all a projection of a kind of unspoken fixation on mindful nihilism, I suppose almost zen buddhism. The cult members can't explain it to anyone else, and the film doesn't attempt to explain it directly either. Rather - it tries to explore what it means to <i>feel</i> meaningless, and the deep and dark relationships that might form when the meaningless drifters find each other.<p>One feels sad for the family members who've had to watch their loved ones drift away without reason. And yet, perhaps the sheer lack of reason for anything is the most definitive answer.<p>In any case, I enjoyed this film. It felt long, but the extra space allowed the meaning in the environments to deepen within me. It's the kind of dourly tranquil, depressed and strangely philosophical film that is uniquely Japanese. I'd be lying however if I said I didn't almost drift off at multiple points, and some of the editing and narrative decisions may have left the exposition a bit too dry.

Louis gets money in exchange for his films. The studio gets films which gets them higher ratings. The station manager gets job security. The assistant gets a wage that allows him to live. The public get footage which they devour. Excluding the things that Louis does which cause harm to others, he actually provides a service to society. In the basic aspects, Louis is living the American dream as it was intended.<p>Louis is such a great character in my mind because, on the one hand, he is of course despicable - but on the other hand, a lot of the sleazy stuff he does is explain-away-able. His associates knew what they were getting into after all - they knew most of the risks. He plays the game the best. A dark part of me almost wants to see him beat his competition (into the ground). And that gives me pause to think what I might do if my morals were a little looser and my desperation were a little higher.<p>I've been studying basic economics in my own personal capacity lately, and it seems clear to me that capitalism is the best system of the lot. Now though, there's a sour taste in my mouth - I realize that this system allows (and will continue to allow) people like Louis to rise to the top. And we may prosper.<p>EDIT: I think people misunderstand the film's musical choices and characterization. This film is a social commentary and dryly satirical.

Today I have found possibly the best alpine film - by chance. You see, I have felt the drive to find a mountain movie for many years because I have myself spent a large portion of my childhood under the shadow of mountains (not as grand as the Alps I'll grant, but still). There is something about that experience that this film captures perfectly, but also something more.<p>To be in a lowly populated region surrounded by summits is a mystical experience. It's the scale that grabs you - you are surrounded by objects so big that it is difficult for the mind to truly comprehend the distance needed to traverse and climb them. Their age is incomprehensible as well - the span of wars, civilization, and humanity itself are but the blink of an eye to these rocks. So profound is their objection to the earth, that the sky itself is interrupted by their peaks.<p>Essentially, to live in a mountain valley is to be humbled constantly. That fierce cultural tradition follows in these regions is also then no surprise. And this film does well to capture that awe - this family lives on the slant of a truly grand sierra.<p>The framing is perfect. For starters, the image is tall, but also varied in scope. There are intimate shots of the family huddled in their small gas-lit home, and long shots across the span of the range itself. But, importantly, there are no shots which capture the entirety of the mountain on which they live - and thus the mystique of the mountain's innumerable scale is maintained and placed in suspense.<p>The entire film is naturally lit, or at least does well to present that illusion, and this forces the viewer to absorb the human nature of every space - that the house was built painstakingly by hand, and that all of the land must be controlled by hand. The mountain is happy to live in coexistence.<p>The central character of this film is the daughter, Brenni, who has had to give up her hopes of becoming a teacher to help care for the son. She is a kind person, humbled (as is everyone) and naturally caring. She enjoys playing with her brother and trying to teach him to read. She likes her radio and makeup as well, but does not begrudge her parents if they are unwilling to get her new things.<p>The parents are everything you'd expect of a kind germanic home - generally quiet, pious, honest, and hard working. They go along their lives not expecting more or less, but simply content.<p>And then, we have the boy. He means well... but man does he do some stupid things... in particular, damage to tools. Father is not impressed, but he too is humble, and he forgives what is clearly the act of misunderstanding over malicious intent. Yet, one feels with every misstep that the wellspring of patience runs drier.<p>The boy is inherently fascinated. In particular, the magic of the mountains is an illusion he can never quite unravel. He starts building totems and huge spans of rock walls along the mountain face - one imagines that left to his own devices he might attempt to chip away the whole cliff. Is the mountain pleased with his devotion? The valley certainly grows more rocky.<p>I daren't spoil the developments of the film past here, except to say I have never experienced such dread and horror with equal measures of contentment and intimacy in a film until this one. It places in perfect perspective what is probably the gravest social taboo and makes a case for it, and it is absolutely marvellous.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/jOVB5 target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Adelheid (1970)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/113456.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Adelheid (1970)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 4 September 2017</i></header><p>An aimless film of ghostly post-war depression, of romance based on the withdrawal from loneliness, of power relationships not dissimilar to <i>The Servant</i>, and of uncertainty as to the nature of reality.<p>These are all riffs though, the film in bare terms lacks a strong central thread and straddles the line between languid and tiresome for the majority of its runtime.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/jPCqz target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>Zero Dark Thirty (2012)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/97630.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Zero Dark Thirty (2012)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 3 September 2017</i></header><p>A precisely tuned intelligence procedural.

The flaw of moral comprehension in these characters is evidenced by their single-minded attempt to hunt down UBL. That is a moral failing.<p>What more is desired? Should a line of dialogue have been inserted by an unrelated character to condemn their actions? Should there have been an added scene?

Finding coincidences between this event and that person, making leaps to draw conclusions, getting a chance to become an important person in the world, and feeling as if justice is being done. This encompasses Costner's motivations and Oliver Stone's, and what he hopes the audience will feel as well. And boy, is it an exciting and agitated 3 hour film (this feels like it was made at the peak of the &quot;cocaine years&quot;.)<p>But it also fights against true critical reasoning. Stringing leaps together does the opposite of landing at a greater truth. Having recently read a <i>Skeptic</i> article investigating JFK assassination conspiracies - I'll highlight a few notable flaws here:<ul><li>The positioning of JFK relative to John Connally was actually diagonal and elevated - not behind and level. The single bullet theory is quite plausible.<li>The actual bullet impact indicates a slight move to the right for JFK. The sudden jolt to the left is consistent with a neuromuscular reaction, and bullet impacts do not cause the huge forces necessary to create the large jolt (that is an idea popularized in movies).<li>Of all the witnesses interviewed, 81% heard 3 shots... only 5% heard 4 shots or more. Only the 5% are considered.<li>Of the witnesses supposedly killed in mysterious circumstances - only one was actually a witness, the rest are only associated in obtuse ways.
If you are interested, I highly recommend reading the (referenced) article: https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/jfk-conspiracy-theories-at-50-how-the-skeptics-got-it-wrong-and-why-it-matters/</ul><p>What is interesting is the degree to which Stone desperately wants to sell this idea - by stretching truth. That ultimately works in the films favor - because while this film is not a valid conspiracy theory, it undoubtedly reeks of passion. It is exciting, beautifully shot, and charismatically led by Kevin Costner - whose desperate and tireless crusade has rarely been matched in cinema.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/jHLlx target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Doubt (2008)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/14359.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Doubt (2008)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 30 August 2017</i></header><p>Coincidentally, I was reading through an excellent <i>Skeptic</i> article on the JFK assassination (https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/jfk-conspiracy-theories-at-50-how-the-skeptics-got-it-wrong-and-why-it-matters/) when I began watching this. That focused my opinion on the central theme here: the line between skepticism and cynicism; critical evaluation and conspiratorial feeling; intuition and reason; emotion and rationality.<p>The fact is, we cannot know what occurred between the priest and the boy. The wine is not evidence, and can be circumstantially used to prove either position. As is the case with all conspiracy: when motive is lacking on behalf of the accused, it is more than matched by the motive of the conspirator. The fact that the JFK assassination was mentioned at the beginning of the film sets all these ideas up quite well - the notion of a loss of innocence and a doubt in authority's intentions (a doubt that persists regardless of overwhelming evidence in that case).<p>I'll leave you to make your own judgements about the guilt of the priest. All of the cast did a stellar job - I'd say the best performance in any scene was had by Viola Davis on the walk home to work. Beyond that, I'd say this is more a work of consistently precise acting than a composition of rawly powerful standoff performances - but that's hardly a criticism.<p>Praise aside, one can't help but come away from this film with a degree of disappointment. It is of course deliberately made to be uncertain, and it nails it, but I do have concerns as to whether extreme doubt in the conclusion of a film can work even if it is done well. I liked it in sum nonetheless.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/jGGUZ target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Turner &amp; Hooch (1989)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/6951.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Turner &amp; Hooch (1989)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 30 August 2017</i></header><p>Though sweet, the free-and-loose approach to police investigation causes it to lose any kind of serious core.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/jGrlF target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Buffalo &#39;66 (1998)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/9464.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Buffalo &#39;66 (1998)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 26 August 2017</i></header><p>This film has a decidedly indie flavor to it- well indie is a word that doesn't describe much of anything does it? Perhaps it means pretentious, or small, or emotional. Does it mean outside of the mainstream? In fact, the term &quot;indie&quot; (as I've defined it) applies well here.<p>This film doesn't have much faith in it's own narrative. It meanders between conviction of the ideas and tropes it utilizes, and a kind of general, nihilistic saunter. It comes off at times a little warbling, at other times a little human, but mostly it feels like Gallo struggling to decide what to do with his film. That might not be the case, but that's how it <i>feels</i>.<p>If this was all the film had to offer it would be a damn aggravating shame - but thankfully it's saved by two damn things. First: Cristina Ricci, and secondly: the look.<p>Ricci has a talent for deadpan. Given how deliberately uninspiring her character (and all characters) in this film are, it takes a special kind of knack to give that character the needed dark and kooky edge. She can only do it through delivery, looks, and demeanor (because it sure as hell wasn't in the script) - and she does. There's a reason she was cast in <i>The Addams Family</i>, and she has a form of acting &quot;bent&quot; which I don't think is as appreciated as it ought to be.<p>Secondly: the film's look. It has the dreary, dead-end, middle-America mood to it - the kind of place where the inhabitants know they couldn't make it anywhere else, and decide to either embrace their small-time existence - or start drinking, and eventually arrive at a maudlin existential angst. This is the part Gallo is interested in, anyway.<p>Scenes are lit quite bright and stark, it seems as if all of the film takes place under overcast weather or under a fluorescent gleam.

Her character is a difficult beast - she has to be worthy of sympathy and worthy of enmity in equal measure, and also convincingly strange enough to make her various conflicting traits consistent.

I mean, I don't buy this whole &quot;acceptance of religious belief&quot; stuff from Elizabeth - nor do I enjoy the assignment of heroic traits to some characters and villainy to others to try and commercialize the whole affair.

Then, when I read on the cover &quot;A Film by Darren Aronofsky&quot;, I though this was going to be unbearably intense. I'm happy to say I was wrong on both accounts. There are some great aspects to this film:<p>The first great thing is that it falls into the category of (what I like to call) &quot;unconventional procedurals&quot;. We see the tightly-knit intimacies of the wrestling community, the damn employers, the slight income from each gig, the tricks-of-the-trade, and the professional lingo.<p>The second great thing we see is Mickey Rourke, who is damn near perfect for, and in this role. Who better to try and uncontradict the idea of a sweet-hearted super wrestler than Rourke - who's been tough and tender his whole career? Infact, Rourke was an amateur boxer, and rewrote much of his dialogue in this film.<p>The third great thing we see are the relationships, principally between Rourke the Wrestler and Tomei the Stripper. One is selling the extreme end of his masculinity - the other the extreme end of her femininity. You get the sense that they've both caused mayhem in their lives, neither is afraid of a little fight, and both care about their child who they think they might destroy, or - conversely - might never salvage.<p>In a lesser film one would expect the strong man and the beautiful stripper relationship to basically boil down to carnal sex and conflict, but in this film it's based on a subtextual knowing and mutual respect of what it takes to sell your flesh to strangers.<p>The final, and by no means trivially great thing about this film is simply the nature of the narrative; the presentation. This film is not - as one might expect - an action film (though there is action), nor an excruciatingly intense Aronofsky film.<p>No - what this is is a truly <b>classic</b> drama. It's the 21st Century's <i>Cool Hand Luke</i>- with brilliant characters, timeless themes, a finely structured script and lush performances from old dogs.<p>Oh and if you enjoy a bit of Mickey Rourke tushie you will not be disappointed.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/ifc4r target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Night Riders (1981)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/327438.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Night Riders (1981)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 29 June 2017</i></header><p><a href=https://letterboxd.com/sl1m/list/the-top-300-czechoslovakian-films-as-rated/>[#224 of CSFD's Top 300]</a>
Upon starting the movie, I was concerned that this was going to be a low quality and highly one sided patriotic effort.<p>Though it is still a low budget film, I was surprised at how even handed it took both sides. It is not a matter of good vs. bad, just a conflict of people with misaligned goals.<p>The film for me was entertaining only in this regard, but just weighing both sides in terms of morals and actions was of sufficient interest to give me an overall positive view of the film. The performances all-round are fine (though the wife's performances raised concerns, thankfully she didn't get too much screen time), which is not really an issues since the scope of the film and characters doesn't really warrant standout performances.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/iaPeb target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>Manhunter (1986)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/11454.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Manhunter (1986)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 27 June 2017</i></header><p>In some ways this feels like the culmination of American 80s crime cinema; it is the essence of what one wants from the 80s aesthetic.

All are equal, but some are more equal than others.<p>The framing, lighting and staging here are particularly excellent. It's a dark place this world - a place of grey urban depression, and it comes in to stark contrast with idyllic flashbacks of white marble quarries, misty forests, rolling hills, and expansive lakes.<p>I initially found this film a little mild for the first half. It had all the marks of a historical drama, but it wasn't really firing. In the second half however, the core nature of our characters - which had been subtly exposited during the first half and determinedly tested (I realized) - were brought to the fore with dramatic consequence. So a bit of a slow-burner, but ultimately quite a competent drama.<p>What's interesting is that our lead character is not following a completely moral compass. She has her own goals, and she is to some degree naive about who she drags in; what she sets off. But this is fine, because this is real. The actions we take in our teenage years are not perfect, and this is doubly true in the questionable times of Stalin rule.<p>I look forward to the next two films in the trilogy, with some trepidation over pacing.<p>EDIT: Oh wow, this is actually a quadrilogy!<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/hBKHH target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Family Resemblances (1996)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/14646.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Family Resemblances (1996)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 2 June 2017</i></header><p>A very straight family drama - made good by solid performances, relatively interesting cinematography, and a good tone of familial anger mixed with slight humour.

I expected it to be well produced and humorous, but I didn't expect it to be dryly absurd and (yet) deftly dramatic.<p>Winston goes against type as a rather sensitive, caring, and calm man. The same in revere applies to Kingsley. Both perform brilliantly - largely because they flesh out characters which are rather unexpected of them.<p>The exposition and development of this film lives on archetypes: the characters develop by both wildly embracing and risibly going against the respective tenants of their breed. Like demi-devil McShane playing a professional and cold mannered gangster who also embraces in professional and cold mannered orgies.<p>The film is strikingly well shot. Locations are real, and stunning. The image is well focused, and fine grained. The framing is exciting: it captures the beauty of each setting with well formed and cinematic medium shots, and the tensity of each performance with intense and inescapable close ups.<p>There is plenty of flourish too - highly vibrant lighting, shots that follow swinging doors, and one which even risks a &quot;misaligned film negative&quot; effect. In many films, this kind of overly stylistic brandishing might come across as pulpy (I'm looking at you Tarantino) but the cinematography here is more than matched by the abilities of the actors and the ludicrous competency of the script. The film stays grounded.<p>This film is a dashing thing of preposterous realism, but by embracing that duality so fully in all respects of it's production... it avoids being a contradiction.

The main focus of the film is a kind of fever dream of confusion, of happy secluded Scottish pagans. This is indeed as weird as it sounds.<p>This includes poppy; folky, ritualistic music videos. It includes organs (bodily organs) being sold in general stores. It includes children learning about phallic symbols and death rituals.<p>The oddest thing in all this, perhaps, is that it isn't scary. Infact, I might describe it as anti-horror - a horror that arises from a feeling of local normality and a lack of horror scares. But don't mistake that for a feeling of stability - herein lies the underlying suspense. Again, the tone is idyllically strange, which comes across in a feeling of surreal dread.<p>There's something to be said about our protagonist's journey being a biblical one - a judicious Christian cop, who goes maverick and defies the Pagans. He is confused about their (and likely his) faith, challenged by the lack of outrage in the people around him and their seeming bliss. There are enormous parallels to a key biblical moment at the end of the film, but I won't go into details.<p>Is this island mystical, or is it just highly controlled behind the scenes? Is Howie acting consciously of his own volition in a confusing place, or is he being led through a strange local spiritual realm? Is the Lord sincerely religious, or an opportunistic cult leader? If there is a God in this film, who's side is God on?<p>All of this is left ambiguous - to the betterment of the film - as it enforces the feverish surreal normalcy of it all and increases re-watch value.<p>All in all, I must say this film is wonderfully unique, and I will enjoy watching it again.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/ga31l target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>The Evil Dead (1981)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/764.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>The Evil Dead (1981)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 2 April 2017</i></header><p>The great thing about this film is that it knows precisely what it is - an ultra cheap B movie horror. It knows that some of the things it does to make the horror work are silly, and then it points and says &quot;Ha! Wasn't that great? Look at the blood!&quot;.<p>It's somewhat congruous to think of two-camera sitcoms - obviously fake, removed from reality - yet highly engrossing. It's because the formalist staging makes it cinematic. The controlled environments, lighting and cheapness of some of the effects are cinematic instead of irritating, and it's aided by the film being humble and sincere in its course.<p>However, there is nothing cheap about the cinematography. The film is largely a mix of medium, close up, and extreme close ups - often very cinematic and exhibition-ary. Angles and pans of varying speed are used all at the right times with a solid sense of the atmosphere from moment to moment. The film is engrossing because each shot proceeds so intricately with the preceding, and you can't wait to see what's next. There is an incredible sense of on-the-go creativity.<p>The action is also great, and it's largely because of the close attention to small details and objects - not just in establishing things like the positions of weapons and limb damage, but also in limiting the knowledge of the larger sphere of combat. We get a sense of intimacy, fear, and entrapment.<p>And boy, is Bruce Campbell made for this role - no one does dumbfounded action hero like he does.<p>It's just a pure classic.

But I underestimated the ability of the film - it does indeed exceed this frame, and builds another mystery around it while I watch a film whose potential I see as limited.<p>What this allows is for some of the key pieces of the real mystery to be developed while you still don't know what that actual overriding mystery is. Genius.<p>The problem, however, is that plot holes remain. If John had some sense, he would find a nice quiet spot, and secure himself down 15 minutes (or more) before the murder was to occur. Supposedly the rationale against this is that he simply &quot;has to know!&quot; blah blah, yada yada (no, sorry, ain't buying it Spielberg).<p>Maybe his colleagues would be willing to secure him to stop him doing anything, maybe they wouldn't because of protocol and bureaucracy, but the point is that we didn't see John consider this or other ideas - that's a problem.<h2>There are a couple other minor plot holes, but again it is interesting to note how these serve the overriding mystery as a result of the audience (or at least me) seeing limited film potential.</h2><p>As for the Sci-Fi - although some of the systems and tech ostensibly seem to have that convenient Hollywood design of being highly operatic in their usage - I have to say that the film does a good job of taking the presupposition of precognition (with some good speculative ideas about technology) to build a fairly hard Sci-Fi world.<p>Performances are decent; the cinematography is quite good; the action sequences are well shot and I disliked the Photoshop glow effect applied to the film. But the film was very enjoyable to watch, especially when it revealed itself as something more than I expected. It opens some very interesting ideas about thriller design for me.<p>I'm curious to see if other people saw the film in the same way, or if my genre savvy caused me to see this film in a strange orthogonal manner that somehow still worked.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/g4Nrn target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Jurassic Park (1993)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/329.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Jurassic Park (1993)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 1 April 2017</i></header><p>A classic - the latter part of the film really gets some good suspense going.

That is, the quality he desires to perfect is ultimate simplicity and poverty, but in the pursuit of this lies much complexity in performance, composition, and costly iteration. His mastery is an internal battle to find the balance.<p>That, in a way, is a metaphor for this film. it is deceptively simple at the beginning, seemingly focused on a simple relationship between a tea master and his lord ,Hideyoshi, but this relationship has much hidden- deep underneath.<p>Rikyu's mindfulness for matters other than tea ceremonies, Hideyoshi's insecurity, and Rikyu's potential influence all come into the fore - but nothing is on the surface; nothing is certain. That's important, because that is the limit of what an insecure leader can see of potential insurrection.<p>Careful and limited character moments develop our understanding of the motivations, flaws and opinions of Rikyu and Hideyoshi. Much of it is done through otherwise mundane moments- such as putting on makeup, learning the tea ceremony, idle chit-chat, etc. The performances of Mikuni and Yamazaki are absolutely masterful, as is the script and direction.<p>The tea ceremony, interestingly, trains the viewer's observation of the film. It is concerned with very precise observations of the otherwise mundane - and it used early in the film to tell us to look carefully at our leads and the cracks in their image. As the film progresses, and we become engrossed in the story, this device becomes less necessary. But it is still used sparingly as reinforcement.<p>I must admit, it's difficult for me to place the brilliance of this film in words- the depth really took me off my guard. I just thought this was going to be about tea, but when things really get tense for our leads, and we see the full potential of their ability and that of the direction and the score - I was blown away at what the real scope is.<p>And on that note, this film has an excellent atmosphere. The climate seems to get colder towards the film's conclusion, and the score is used sparingly so as to enforce the crucial moments where the score does come to life. Again a case of subtlety.<p>All in all, a very pleasant surprise.

The conversations that lead to the tragic plan are not featured in the film. Infact, the only dialogue of any real relevance to the plot are the narrations of letters to parents.<p>Instead the film is a series of vignettes, hard cut with seconds of black silence to give a deliberately disjointed and episodic feeling. These episodes convey a sense of mood towards the present. But the episodes don't really change, and repeat themselves as time progresses. Thus we see that the family's life is in an arduous cycle.<p>It was difficult to focus on this film, because it doesn't really flow in a traditional sense and is ardently numbing (and numbingly depressing), but it is unique.

Our heroes are happy to work in the fields and toil among the men, praising liberty. Everyone is tolerant of all religions. How nice.<p>Also, this isn't an actor's film. I think Orlando's performance is okay (which is to say, not noticeably lacking), some others I would go so far as to call good. But then again, I don't think this a character driven piece, so it's really doesn't adversely affect the film.<p>Now onto the good stuff.<p>This film (this cut) is a triumph of pacing. Even at about three and a quarter hours, I at every stage wanted to see more. Every scene is enjoyable on it's own, and the progression of this story is strong enough to keep me on the hook.<p>We have the general sense that this story will culminate in a battle of course, but we know not precisely how we are going to get there, or who the players will include. But to keep up our interest in the scene-after-scene progression, we have small stories which work as building blocks into the larger one.<p>For example: our young hero changes from a blacksmith into a knight - we have his welcoming to the dessert where he creates some fame from his journey through it - and so on.<p>This is really perfect plotting.<p>As can be expected from Scott, it is perfectly framed and shot at every corner. This world breathes, and I can feel it breathing into me. It shows the tradition and lifestyle of the time, but it doesn't become stuffy or get bogged into it. It is always there to progress character and plot.<p>One scene that sticks in my mind is when Balian sits down with some newly met comrades to some crab at a port, where he has a small scuffle with an important lord passing by. He doesn't get up or get ruffled. We can see immediately that he is not interested in petty politics, and is a man of the people.<p>On a side note, the swordplay and battles are wonderfully executed.<p>All in all, one of those rare epics that flies - though it's progressive stance feels a little too Hollywood.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/dMDqb target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>Platoon (1986)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/792.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Platoon (1986)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 9 February 2017</i></header><p>Charlie Sheen is not an action hero.

It doesn't attempt to use a convoluted plot with surprise twists and revelations like similar films - rather it looks at what it means to be a killer. That is: what does it take to kill, how do they feel about it afterwards, how do they behave with other normal people, and are they evil?<p>The film is very well paced and written. The scenes are controlled: well stated and proportioned. The film doesn't try to cram in exciting action to keep you interested through the total run-time, rather it uses slow, intricate character development to keep you wanting more.<p>The film looks good and sounds good. Naturalistic lighting keeps things dark and local - focusing on the illuminated characters and objects which are the subjects of the particular scene. The soundtrack is excellent, featuring jazz in the calm bits, highly tense deep drums during tense scenes, and silence in general - again an example of restraint and control.<p>All the actors do a solid job. I think the direction and lighting (as specified above) do much to really bring out their performances.<p>Only minor complaint is that the themes don't quite seem to be fully explored - but perhaps I just wasn't looking hard enough.<p>All in all though, a refreshing crime film that hasn't aged at all.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/dE2dN target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/828.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 2 February 2017</i></header><p>Sort of humbly low budget in a charming way - more about humanity than special effects.<p>Although it's novel for it's time, early sci-fi films such as this have undergone so much cultural osmosis that its novelty can really only be felt with knowledge of it's age (the result of which isn't pure novelty, suffice to say).<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/dAtfj target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Hair (1979)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/10654.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Hair (1979)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 2 February 2017</i></header><p>Fantastic music, good acting, decent characters, so-so story.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/dBGN1 target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>Yellow Earth (1984)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/92990.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Yellow Earth (1984)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 2 February 2017</i></header><p>This film captures a sort of naturalistic, mundane tranquility of rural life in a mountainous area- a place without many buildings, with long paths between important locations, and where ambient electric lights on the ground don't distort the sky. The dusks (which are a big part of this film) are incredibly beautiful in their untouched - dim - natural beauty.<p>More beauty is found in the harmonious waving of stove flames in a dim room, in the stark contrasts of cool interiors and harshly sunlit exteriors, in the gentle windy rustling of grain dotting the ground, in the slow winding of spinning wheels, in the contrasts of unpainted brown interiors and saturated red material...<p>I guess this film captures the &quot;focusing on small details&quot; thing that one does in areas with little other entertainment - or at least the thing that I do. As a city boy who has spent much of their childhood visiting relatively rural farms in the Cape, I can say this film captured that experience perfectly.<p>The story is somewhat abstract: a sort of sorrowful folk tune about the hardships and deeply ingrained sadness brought upon by desperate living, the aspects of life that reflect their music and vice-versa, and the hopes that communism <em>might</em> bring.<p>Yes, I think there might be a touch of propaganda here... but then I'm not quite sure to what extent this is pro- or anti- communism. Maybe it is a little too abstract?<p>I think the music grows on you - it grew on me. The girl's singer in particular did an excellent job. That voice rolling across the valley is quite ethereal.<p>The actors here seem to be rural civilians: you can see their acting is naturalistic, and you can feel the toll of work in their voices and faces. A bit like a Herzog film really.<p>This film felt slow at times, yet the running time flew by. Strange?...

They blossom as characters: they become accustomed to their trade, learn how to act with customers, and generally grow more cynical.<li>It looks at the procedural nature of the business, with regulations, gynecologists, mentorship, employer relations, prostitute class distinctions, etc.<li>It has an unexpected (and quite welcome) grand finale.<li>The music is excellent.</ol><p>I was really surprised by how good of a film this is. Highly recommended.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/dgtSb target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>Amores Perros (2000)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/55.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Amores Perros (2000)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 16 January 2017</i></header><p>Excellent film, but I can't deal with dog tragedy - even if I know it's not real.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/deUah target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span><span><i>The Man Who Would Be King (1975)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/983.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>The Man Who Would Be King (1975)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 11 January 2017</i></header><p>A highly solid adventure, though it doesn't quite catch the greatness of Huston's earlier work.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/d6FrB target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>The Last Battle (1983)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/19184.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>The Last Battle (1983)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 8 January 2017</i></header><p>People can't talk, sandy office towers, sex dolls, spears, music recorded on cassettes, easy listening, makeshift camps, midget pipe searchers, makeshift plane, Jean Reno &quot;The Brute&quot; and all manner of strange, wonderful, cheerful post apocalyptic touches.<p>Ranks with the best of the genre.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/d3Ouj target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars></span><span><i>Antigone (1992)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/208200.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Antigone (1992)</h2><h3></h3><i>Reviewed 8 January 2017</i></header><p>I couldn't get through that title, let alone this film.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/d3m5b target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details><details><summary><span class=stars><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></span><span><i>Mandala (1981)</i></span></summary><section><aside><figure><img loading=lazy src=/images/review-posters/255982.jpg width=230 height=345></figure></aside><header><h2>Mandala (1981)</h2><h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star-half"></i></h3><i>Reviewed 7 January 2017</i></header><p>♪ It's tricky to be a buddhist all the time

It doesn't disappoint - the characters are intricate, but relegated to the subject at hand, and the movie concerns itself mostly with what makes the principle nervous, and develops on it. It also uses this as a side entrance to make light of the political situations of the time in a way that is very personal and local, and thus quite affecting.<p><i><a href=https://boxd.it/d0oAJ target=_blank>See on Letterboxd</a></i></section></details></section></article></main><footer><p>© 2024 Liam Pulles.</footer><script src=/script.js></script><script src=https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10/dist/htmx.min.js></script>
