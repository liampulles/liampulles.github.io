But in the
workplace, I've learned from wise old devs and from firsthand experience that
this is not always the case.<p>My philosophy is as follows: <strong>Refactor intrinsically similar code - not
coincidentally similar.</strong><p>Coincidentally similar code is likely to change and differentiate. If you
preemptively pull both sets of logic out into a common function, you'll later
have to create parameters for differences, and you'll dirty your previously
clean code.<p>An example of this might be a plain text template function and an HTML template
function. While the initial implementation of these two functions is the same,
the HTML function will need to be able to escape certain characters in the
future - if you've pulled out a common function, you'll need now need to add a
boolean argument to switch between HTML or plain text (which is ugly).<p>Intrinsically similar code NEEDS to be put in a common function, however. If you
don't do this, you risk a business rule being inconsistently implemented.<p>An example of this is formatting dates as strings. If you identify two separate
pieces (or even one piece) of code which use an anonymous string like
&quot;DD/MM/YYYY&quot; to format a date, that should be pulled out into a global constant
or date utility function. If you don't do this, you risk someone changing one of
the format strings (or adding another anonymous one somewhere) to &quot;MM/DD/YYYY&quot; -
and you'll end up confusing/misinforming your users and potentially making the
client liable.<p>Determining whether similarities are coincidental or intrinsic is a matter of
interrogating your domain, which is an essential part of the job of a developer
anyway.</section><section><h3 id="Aim to minimize shit, not maximize perfection."><a class=anchor href=#Aim%20to%20minimize%20shit%2c%20not%20maximize%20perfection.>Aim to minimize shit, not maximize perfection.</a></h3><aside><figure class=optional><img src=/images/proverbs/roman-sewer.jpg width=768px height=1024px alt="Exposed top-view of an ancient Roman sewer"></figure></aside><p>I think as a junior developer especially, ones desire with code design is to try
and find the absolute perfect abstractions and algorithms, and to over-engineer
solutions.<p>At least that's what I did as a junior. I would spend too much time trying to
perfect rather unimportant aspects of the system, and be disheartened with
the continuing existence of bad code in our codebase.<p>And then I decided to flip my perspective.
Rather than trying to make good things
better, I would try to make bad things less terrible.<p>So as an example: rather than trying to fine-tune a usecase that is already
working okay, I will try to identify important
parts of a
system which are not working well or are of poor quality, and make
a small improvement.<p>This is an acceptance of the fact that software is the product of flawed
corporations and people. And once you accept that, you have achieved zen,
and you can move on to
being productive.</section><section><h3 id="Design by contract"><a class=anchor href=#Design%20by%20contract>Design by contract</a></h3><aside><figure class=optional><img src=/images/proverbs/Design%20by%20contract.webp width=266px height=400px alt="Japanese watercolor of an outset to a forest"></figure></aside><p><em>Source: The Pragmatic Programmer</em><p>Check that the input (and sometimes output) of important

Once you've written and reviewed a piece of code that nonetheless had a bug in
it, you should abandon the silly notion that you can understand code just by
looking at it. Good code has comments in it.<p>BUT you still shouldn't comment for the sake of it. Here I think are good
opportunities for commenting:<ul><li>The steps of a large usecase function. Moving those steps to helper functions
can help too.<li>Any function or piece of code which is working around something; e.g. a badly
designed external API.<li>Assumptions around the form of input which cannot be expressed clearly
with types (though see <a href=#Design%20by%20contract>Design by Contract</a>).<li>Any code which is logically related but where the relationship
cannot be enforced by the code (e.g. needing a struct definition to stay in
sync between a client and repository package).<li>An overview for a complex or relatively alien algorithm.</ul></section></section><section><h2 id=Peopleware><a class=anchor href=#Peopleware>Peopleware</a></h2><section><h3 id="Prioritize people over architecture"><a class=anchor href=#Prioritize%20people%20over%20architecture>Prioritize people over architecture</a></h3><aside><figure class=optional><img src=/images/proverbs/sailors.jpg width=479px height=600px alt="Propaganda artwork depicting two sailors sharing a drink"></figure></aside><p>Comradery is the most vital resource on a software project. It is more important
than having a good architecture or a clean, well designed codebase.<p>Consider two hypotheticals. In the first case
you have a well-architected, clear, and performant system - but with a team that
does
not trust itself, struggles to make decisions, and which has endless bad
arguments about all-manner of minutia.<p>Then consider a second case. The codebase is full of spaghetti code, takes
hours to deploy, and is relatively unclear - but the team embraces its
constituent members, people jump in and help each other at a moments notice,
decisions are made dispassionately and quickly, and individuals
are largely empowered to decide how to code their own tickets as they see fit.<p>My bet is that the first team is going to be relatively unproductive in real
terms (that is, being slow to deliver the <em>right</em> business functionality)
and the second team will conversely be strangely effective. And the second team will
be able to pragmatically refactor its system over time, whereas the first team
will lack the openness to discuss and address real arising problems with their
system.</section><section><h3 id="Corollary #1: Major review comments are for broken code only"><a class=anchor href=#Corollary%20%231%3a%20Major%20review%20comments%20are%20for%20broken%20code%20only>Corollary #1: Major review comments are for broken code only</a></h3><aside><figure class=optional><img src=/images/proverbs/scholar-reading.jpg width=513px height=600px alt="Dutch painting of a scholar reading in study"></figure></aside><p>Don't make major, blocking code review comments if it is a difference of
opinion, even if you are only doing so to force a discussion. I would
even say you shouldn't make a major comment if something is violating the
architecture, but still works.<p>Major comments should only be used if there is a bug that will cause business
requirements to fail.<p>This is based on the ideas of comradery
being key, the architecture of a system being a living thing,
and that people should be
empowered to do their work as they see fit (provided their solution works).<p>You can use minor comments though. Make it clear to the team that your nits are
purely optional and they need not even be read.<p>I'm quite a rigorous reviewer, and this balance means I generally give 1 or
two major comments and a dozen (sometimes several dozen) minors.
I find that 90% of the time the
reviewee will happily correct all the majors and most of the minors without
any argument.

by defining the same methods on itself.<p>While this can be useful for abstracting external types, it is often nice to be

that - provided your dev tool can be installed via the shell - you can automate

exists. If it does not, the associated directive will be executed, which then
leads to the <code>install</code> directive being executed, and finally whatever
shell commands are needed to install the program are run.<p>Another benefit of this abstraction is that if you update the tool, you can just
advise the team to run <code>make install-golangci-lint</code> manually.</section></section></article></main><footer><p><b>Comments? Send me an <a href=mailto:me@liampulles.com>email</a>.
