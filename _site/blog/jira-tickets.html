In fact I'd put them at a similar weight to my IDE in terms of value (seriously). Here I'll show you how I use them in the hopes that it will give you some ideas.</section><section><h2>Tickets as a blueprint</h2><aside><figure><img src=/images/thinking-dev.webp height=512 width=512 alt="A software developer leaning back in his chair thinking hard about his work. Thought bubbles, casual clothing, brown hair."></figure></aside><p>When I pick up a ticket, I'll start by making a series of TODOs on it, and then continue to refine it down into the finest detail I can. For simple tasks, this is a 10 minute procedure - for more complex ones, it can easily take an hour (or more).<p>I usually start by making bullet points which list the high level elements involved (e.g. this db table, this service, this util, etc). Then I will turn this into a series of explicit steps (e.g. migrate the column for this table, delete this code, create a new service class, etc).<p>The rule I have in mind when doing this is to get to the point where there is no ambiguity about what needs to be done. I will look through the codebase and talk to people while I do this.<p>Some notes on this:<ol><li>Planning upfront like this inevitably leads to better design and less rework. I'll see that steps conflict and rewrite the plan before rewriting the code.<li>Since I've the thinking upfront, when I do get to coding, I can get into "flow" more easily and hold on to it for longer.<li>And since I'm in flow longer, I find that I complete my work more quickly (even with the added planning time).<li>As I progress through my TODOs, I mark the individual pieces as <code>[DONE]</code>. This keeps me motivated, and gives me an accurate indication of progress.<li>I think this has made me better at seeing what is involved in a ticket off the cuff. This helps immensely during stand up and sprint planning.<li>My ability to estimate tasks has improved. And if the task does go over, this TODO list serves as a good resource for me to explain <i>why</i> I need to go over.<li>If I see any tasks that need to be done first, I'll action those upfront. For example, I might talk with another team to update their API so they can do that while I am busy. This obviously helps avoid blocks/stucks.<li>TODOs immensely with context switching. When I switch tickets, I can read my TODOs and jump back in to coding. Also if I am waiting on something (e.g. a deployment), then I can easily find something small from these lists to action.<li>I am hoping that these TODOs act as a historical artifact for future devs (they can see my reasons for writing such bad code. ðŸ˜‰)<li>I've gotten feedback from my manager and colleagues that these help a lot to get a sense of my progress (particularly when there are tasks dependent on my work). This pre-sight helps them to plan and for me explain my work.</ol><p>Note that this does not stop unexpected things from coming up during coding, but it does help reduce them. And when those moments do come up I try to go plan again before coding.</section><section><h2>Tickets as a second brain</h2><aside><figure><img src=/images/thinking-goldfish.webp height=512 width=512 alt="A goldfish leaning back in his chair thinking hard about his work. Thought bubbles."></figure></aside><p>I often say (only half joking) that I have the memory of a goldfish. I treat my brain as an ephemeral cache: any value could fall away at any time. My tickets serve as a backing database for my brain.<p>Extending this cache-db analogy: I'll write to that persistent storage regularly. If, while coding, a disparate question pops into my brain - I'll note the question down in the ticket and then carry on coding. This keeps me in flow. Later I will look through the ticket and ensure all items are actioned before submitting for review.<p>This practice serves to enable a kind of agile Plan-Do-Reflect mode of working. Instead of just barraging through code, uncertain of where I am going, I am making steady steps with a clear path ahead. It leads to more inner peace (I think).</section><section><h2>Tickets as asynchronous communication</h2><aside><figure><img src=/images/thinking-cyberpunk.webp height=512 width=512 alt="A man sitting in his chair hacking into the matrix."></figure></aside><p>I work at a fully remote company, and so good asynchronous communication is vital. If I have a ticket-related question then I will sometimes ping colleagues on a ticket rather than Slacking them. My rationale being:<ul><li>They get the notification via email and so are not interrupted (by a slack notification bell).<li>The context for the question is on the ticket itself.<li>That conversation, and all other relevant conversations, are all available on the ticket.</ul><p>Although having said that, people's preferences differ. One should respect the communication channels others prefer, especially when asking them for help.</section><section><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Anyway, I hope I've given you something to think about. I'm curious if you have found other good uses for tickets - if so, please do email me.</section></article></main><footer><p><b>Comments?
