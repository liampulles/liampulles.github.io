    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a 24 year old software developer currently working in Johannesburg, South Africa for BSG. I completed my honors in Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand (my research focusing on demosaicking and decorrelation stretch methods) in 2017.</p>
    <p>I’m familiar with Java, Python and C, and I have some experience in Javascript, PHP, CSS, Delphi, Typescript, Go, and shell scripting. I have studied Image Procssing, Computer Vision, and Robotics - among other subjects. I am familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, Spring (and other Java frameworks) - among other technologies.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include working on small coding and linux related projects, as well as viewing a variety of films (I suppose I could be called a “film buff”).</p>
