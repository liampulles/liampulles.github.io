<p>Check that the input and output of important functions are sensible. This can be as simple as a few <code>assert</code> statements, e.g.</p>
{% highlight go %}
public sendSms(String cell) {
    assert PhoneValidationUtil.ValidNumber(cell);
   // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Do this instead of defensive programming, and apply selectively - put it on your core business logic for specific variables; resources.</p>
<p>By doing this, you'll help minimize unexpected costly mistakes where bad data gets through to your business logic.</p>
