<p>Go has <i>structural typing</i>, so a type implements an interface if it defines the same method signatures.</p>
<p>While this can be useful for abstracting external types, it is often nice to be able to check at compile time that a type implements an interface.</p>
<p>A nice pattern I've seen for this is to assign an unnamed global variable of the interface type to an implementation instance, e.g.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/liampulles/ae4ab6989b0f80f09306aa52be9537fe.js"></script>
<p>Here we check that BasicThingy and *StructThingy implement Hashable. If they don't, the compiler will generate a nice error message pointing at the assignment. 
For this reason, it is nice to put this assignment next to the implementation type declaration.</p>
