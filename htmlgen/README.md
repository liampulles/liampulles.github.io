htmlgen converts markdown-ish files to HTML.

The rationale is that:

1. I want to use some things that markdown does not support natively
1. I want to generate my own html, because I don't like what is typically the output of markdown templators.

My own markup variant is still mostly markdown, and will use the same extension - this is because I still want to leverage syntax highlighting in my IDE.
