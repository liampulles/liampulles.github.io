<p>Check that the input and output of important functions are sensible. This can be as simple as a few <code>assert</code> statements, e.g.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/liampulles/eacd3ae1d082a34b6fbc5688c27056f7.js"></script>
<p>Do this instead of defensive programming, and apply selectively - put it on your core business logic for specific variables; resources</p>
