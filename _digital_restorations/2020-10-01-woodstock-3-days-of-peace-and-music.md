    <p>The genesis of this restoration was my sisters birthday. Having asked her what she might like, she noted that
    she might like a print from a digital poster on Etsy...</p>

    <p>That seemed like a good option to me -  So I found this woodstock poster for a reasonable price, got a digital download link for it
    and was... horrified. Though the seller had advertised that the print was suitable for an A1 print, the cheap scan
    they gave my was barely suitable for printing on an A4.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the image I've restored is suitable for a 300 DPI
    print for an A1 size poster. ;)</p>
